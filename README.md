# Training and inference YOLO

Small demo training YOLO and performing inference on a video.
The dataset used was [sku-110k](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/sku-110k/) and this is the video used as an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UPHStsW-4&list=LL&index=1&t=1267s&ab_channel=SouthernASMRSounds).
### why Shelves?
Shelves are a good exercise because they contain many items and in the video example in particular the camera moves quite fast. And it's difficult to keep track of the items.
### Performance:
The performance is on pair with what is expected from yolo: 
mAP: 0.58
mAP_50: 0.91
mAP_75: 0.67

### Demo of the performance of the model in the wild:
[Here](https://youtu.be/K0j1s0mdeR4) you can see how the model performs in the example video.
